# Paste-Hub
Paste to many different sites.

# Supported Sites (Native)
* Hatebin.com
* Hastebin.com
* Any clone using (an unmodified) [Haste-Server](https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-server).

# Unsupported Sites
* Pastebin; their API is paid.
* Privatebin; it's not worth the effort (many "supported" clients don't work correctly).
* Any sites not listed above (submit a request and I may add them).

# FWIW
* Do not use ``hastebin`` if you are interested in reliability.
* Sites reliable in my testing: ``hatebin.com`` and ``hasteb.in``.
